This is just a short description of some tools that have been used to add
developer-specific features to the package:

## testthat

Tests were initialized by calling `usethis::use_testthat()` from the R terminal.

## R CMD check

Package checking workflows were added by calling
`usethis::use_github_action('check-standard')` from the R terminal.
